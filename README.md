# Ensuring Legal Drinking Age Compliance

**Objective:** To develop and assess the efficacy of a computer vision model aimed at verifying the age of customers in the checkout area of Good Seed supermarkets in order to prevent the sale of alcohol to underage individuals.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the model must have a mean absolute error (MAE) value of at most 8. My model acquired a value of 6.7914.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Computer vision techniques (e.g. horizontal flips, zooming, and rotation), model architecture selection, optimization algorithm (Adam) deployment, and model evaluation
